# 3PlayerChess

> Written by **Joseph Ewbank**

This chess game is hopefully somewhat intuitive. 
The source code can all be found in `src`

## Usage
To use, first download [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.html).

Then, to play the game run `chess.jar`

```shell
java -jar chess.jar
```

**Suggestions:**
- The AI isn't fully developed and can be slop. I would suggest playing yourself if you can't find others.
- A size 8 board is pretty standard.
- To use the host/client feature, the clients will need the IP address of the host.
